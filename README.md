# 🛍️ Customer Churn Prediction App

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their past behavior and purchases. It combines **feature engineering**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and a **Random Forest classifier** packaged into a robust **ML pipeline**. A **FastAPI backend** serves predictions, and a **Streamlit frontend** provides an interactive user interface.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Performed **EDA** to understand customer behavior and patterns.  
✅ Engineered features from raw data to improve model performance.  
✅ Encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.  
✅ Built a **Random Forest** classifier and optimized hyperparameters.  
✅ Packaged preprocessing and model steps into a **scikit-learn pipeline** for reusability.  
✅ Created a **FastAPI REST API** for batch predictions.  
✅ Developed a **Streamlit frontend** for easy CSV uploads and visualizing predictions.
